Everyone loves a good coupon. But if you’re tired of getting emails that are no longer useful to you, it’s possible to unsubscribe on a sender-by-sender basis.

You can manually unsubscribe the old fashioned way using the following methods:

**Unsubscribe Link**

This is the fastest way to manually unsubscribe, assuming they have a link. And of course, they should have one in order to comply with CAN-SPAM laws.

So assuming the sender hasn’t forgotten to provide you with an unsubscribe link, it’s fairly straightforward to stop getting their emails. Just navigate to the bottom of the most recent email from them, and click on the text that says “unsubscribe” or something similar.


## Why Unsubscribe From Emails?

Yahoo offers the biggest storage amongst the vast numbers of email providers out there, a whopping 1TB of free space. No matter what you do, you most likely will never be able to burn through 1TB of email storage. This means you never have to delete any message ever, doesn’t it? Well, not quite.

You see, the more messages you have to search through, the more difficult it will be to find important emails. While you may not run out of storage space, you might run out of patience sorting through social notifications, marketing newsletters, and other promotional messages. Keeping your mailbox clean will help you save time running through important emails and increase productivity.
